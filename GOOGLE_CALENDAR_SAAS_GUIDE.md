# Google Calendar Integration - SaaS Multi-Tenant Guide

## 🏢 **SaaS Multi-Tenant Architecture**

This Google Calendar integration is designed for **SaaS applications** where:

- **Each subscriber** manages their own Google Calendar integration independently
- **No shared credentials** - maximum security and privacy
- **No administrator setup required** - completely self-service
- **Scalable** - works for unlimited users without API limits conflicts

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **User Experience:**

1. **User goes to Settings → API Integrations**
2. **User creates their own Google Cloud Console project** (5-minute process)
3. **User enters their own Client ID and Client Secret**
4. **User authorizes OAuth access** to their calendar
5. **User enjoys automatic synchronization** with their calendar

### **Technical Architecture:**

- Each user stores their own `google_calendar_client_id` and `google_calendar_client_secret_encrypted`
- OAuth tokens are tied to user's own app credentials
- No central configuration or shared API limits
- Complete isolation between subscribers

---

## 👤 **User Setup Process**

### **Step 1: Google Cloud Console Setup**

Each user needs to:

1. **Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**
2. **Create a new project** (or use existing)
3. **Enable Google Calendar API**:

   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search "Google Calendar API"
   - Click "Enable"

4. **Configure OAuth consent screen**:

   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" for user type
   - Fill required fields (App name, User support email, etc.)
   - Add scopes: `../auth/calendar` and `../auth/calendar.events`

5. **Create OAuth2 credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Add authorized redirect URI: `https://yourdomain.com/google-calendar/callback`

### **Step 2: App Configuration**

In PhysioTracker:

1. **Go to User Settings → API Integrations**
2. **Check "Enable Google Calendar Integration"**
3. **Enter your credentials**:
   - **Client ID**: From Google Cloud Console
   - **Client Secret**: From Google Cloud Console
   - **Redirect URI**: Leave blank (auto-generated)
4. **Save settings**

### **Step 3: OAuth Authorization**

1. **Click "Authorize Google Calendar Access"**
2. **Complete Google OAuth flow**
3. **Start syncing events automatically**

- ✅ **No API costs** or limit management
- ✅ **User self-service** reduces support tickets

---

## 🔒 **Security Features**

- **Client secrets encrypted** using application encryption keys

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **User Table - New Fields:**

```sql
-- User's own Google app credentials
google_calendar_client_id TEXT
google_calendar_client_secret_encrypted TEXT  -- Encrypted
google_calendar_redirect_uri VARCHAR(500)

-- OAuth tokens for user's calendar
google_calendar_token_encrypted TEXT          -- Encrypted
google_calendar_refresh_token_encrypted TEXT  -- Encrypted
google_calendar_enabled BOOLEAN
google_calendar_primary_calendar_id VARCHAR(255)
google_calendar_last_sync DATETIME
```

### **Treatment Table - Google Integration:**

```sql
google_calendar_event_id VARCHAR(255)     -- Google event ID
google_calendar_event_summary VARCHAR(255) -- Event title
```

---

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

### **Environment Variables:**

No Google Calendar environment variables needed! Users provide their own credentials.

### **Database Migration:**

The migration has been applied automatically to add all necessary fields.

### **SSL/HTTPS Requirements:**

- Google OAuth requires HTTPS for redirect URIs
- Ensure your domain has valid SSL certificate

---

## 🎯 **User Onboarding**

### **Recommended Flow:**

1. **Show user the benefits** of connecting Google Calendar
2. **Provide link to this guide** or simplified instructions
3. **Offer support** for Google Cloud Console setup if needed
4. **Highlight security benefits** of user-controlled integration

### **Support Tips:**

- Most users complete setup in 5-10 minutes
- Google Cloud Console is free for basic usage
- OAuth consent screen can be in "Testing" mode for personal use
- Redirect URI is auto-generated by the app

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"OAuth Error"**:

   - Check redirect URI matches exactly in Google Console
   - Ensure OAuth consent screen is configured
   - Verify Calendar API is enabled

2. **"Client Secret Invalid"**:

   - Double-check Client Secret from Google Console
   - Ensure it's copied correctly (no extra spaces)

3. **"Access Denied"**:
   - User needs to authorize calendar access
   - Check OAuth scopes in Google Console

---

## 📈 **Scaling Considerations**

- **No central API limits** - each user has their own quota
- **Database grows linearly** with user count (encrypted credentials per user)
- **No shared resources** - completely isolated per subscriber
- **Geographic distribution** supported (users can use any Google region)

---

## 🎉 **Ready to Use!**

The integration is **production-ready** and follows SaaS best practices:

- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture
- ✅ User self-service setup
- ✅ Maximum security and privacy
- ✅ Zero administrator configuration
- ✅ Unlimited scalability

Users will love the control and security this approach provides! 🚀
