# Physiotherapy Treatment Progress Report  

## **Patient Overview**  
**Name:** Filip De Wilde  
**Diagnosis:** Left clavicular fracture rehabilitation  
**Treatment Duration:** 2 months, 3 weeks (21 sessions)  
**Initial Pain Level:** 1/10  
**Latest Pain Level:** 6/10  

Filip presented with post-fracture rehabilitation of the left clavicle, with primary goals to restore shoulder range of motion (ROM) in flexion, external rotation (ER), internal rotation (IR), and abduction (ABD). Secondary concerns included right knee cartilage irritation (+) and muscular tension in the shoulder girdle.

## **Clinical Assessment**  

### **Initial Findings (Session 1, 2025-01-13)**  
- **ROM (AROM):**  
  - Flexion: 75°  
  - Extension: 25°  
  - ER: 15°  
  - IR: 35°  
  - ABD: 90°  
- **PROM:** Flexion >90° with active resistance; ER improved with anterior-posterior (AP) mobilization.  
- **Pain:** Minimal (1/10).  
- **Key Impairments:**  
  - Limited ER and flexion due to stiffness in pectoralis major, trapezius, and rotator cuff.  
  - Trigger points in trapezius, infraespinatus, and pectorals.  

### **Functional Limitations**  
- Difficulty with overhead movements (e.g., tennis strokes).  
- Reduced endurance in shoulder-loaded activities.  

---  

## **Treatment Approach**  

### **Interventions**  
1. **Manual Therapy:**  
   - Joint mobilizations (AP glides for ER, scapulohumeral rhythm training).  
   - Soft tissue release (pectoralis major, trapezius, infraespinatus, subscapularis).  
   - Trigger point therapy (active points in trapezius, infraespinatus, latissimus dorsi).  

2. **Therapeutic Exercise:**  
   - Progressive ROM drills (Kabat diagonals, circumduction with ER).  
   - Strengthening (2–3.5 kg weights for ER, biceps, push-up plus).  

3. **Modalities:**  
   - TENS for pain modulation (Session 4).  
   - Massage gun for myofascial release (Session 15).  

### **Progression**  
- **Flexion ROM:** 75° → **168°** (124% improvement).  
- **ER ROM:** 15° → **75°** (400% improvement).  
- **Pain:** Fluctuated (1 → 6/10 post-corticosteroid injection and increased activity).  

---  

## **Progress Evaluation**  

### **Key Improvements**  
- **Functional Gains:** Returned to 3-hour tennis sessions (Session 8).  
- **ROM Milestones:**  
  - Flexion surpassed functional threshold (160° by Session 18).  
  - ER reached 75° (near-full recovery).  

### **Challenges**  
- **Pain Spike (6/10):** Likely due to increased load (3.5 kg weights) and residual inflammation post-injection (Session 21).  
- **Residual Stiffness:** Persistent trigger points in pectoralis and latissimus dorsi.  

---  

## **Current Status**  

### **Physical Condition**  
- **ROM:** Near-normal flexion/ER; IR/ABD within functional limits.  
- **Pain:** Moderate (6/10) localized to posterior shoulder (latissimus dorsi).  
- **Self-Management:** Adherent to HEP (2x/day with weights).  

### **Remaining Limitations**  
- Endurance deficits in repetitive overhead motions.  
- Mild scapular dyskinesia during loaded movements.  

---  

## **Recommendations**  

1. **Further Treatment:**  
   - 4–6 sessions focusing on scapular stability (serratus anterior strengthening) and pain modulation.  

2. **Home Program:**  
   - **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–2):**  
     - ER/IR with 2 kg resistance bands (3x15 reps).  
     - Scapular push-up plus (2x10 reps).  
   - **Phase 2 (Weeks 3+):**  
     - Progressive loading (3.5 kg → 5 kg).  

3. **Activity Modification:**  
   - Gradual return to tennis (monitor pain >4/10).  
   - Ice post-activity for inflammation.  

4. **Prevention:**  
   - Daily mobility drills (shoulder circles, pectoral stretches).  

---  

## **Prognosis**  
- **Timeline:** Full functional recovery expected in **4–6 weeks** with consistent HEP.  
- **Factors Influencing Recovery:**  
  - Adherence to load progression.  
  - Management of latent trigger points.  
- **Long-Term Outlook:** Excellent for return to sport; monitor for overuse.
