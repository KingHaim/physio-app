# 🗨️ How to Access the AI Chat Interface

## ✅ **Issue Fixed!**

The AI Chat interface is now properly configured and accessible.

## 🚀 **How to Access the AI Clinical Assistant:**

### **Method 1: Direct Link (Recommended)**

Navigate to: `/user/settings?tab=ai_chat`

Example: `http://localhost:5000/user/settings?tab=ai_chat`

### **Method 2: Through User Settings**

1. Go to **User Settings** (click your profile/settings)
2. Look for the **"AI Clinical Assistant"** tab with a chat icon 💬
3. Click on that tab to open the chat interface

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

The `user_settings` route was missing the `active_tab` parameter, which prevented the AI Chat tab from being properly displayed. This has been resolved by:

1. ✅ Adding `active_tab = request.args.get('tab', 'profile')` to the route
2. ✅ Passing `active_tab=active_tab` to the template
3. ✅ Now the tab system can properly show/hide different sections

## 🎯 **Quick Start:**

1. **Start your Flask application**
2. **Log in** to your account
3. **Navigate to**: `/user/settings?tab=ai_chat`
4. **Start chatting** with the AI assistant!

## 💬 **Try These Questions:**

- "Help me write a SOAP note for shoulder pain"
- "What assessment tests should I use for knee injuries?"
- "Create a treatment plan for lower back pain"
- "How do I document patient progress?"

## 🔒 **Security Note:**

- You must be logged in to access the chat
- Your DeepSeek API key must be configured
- All conversations are private to your account
