GET  /api/patient/<patient_id>/ai-chat/history  # Load conversation history
POST /api/patient/<patient_id>/ai-chat/clear    # Clear conversation history
```

### 3. **Enhanced Patient Pages**

- **AI Assistant Button** on every patient page
- **Modal Chat Interface** with professional UI
- **Context Display** showing what data the AI has access to
- **Save to Notes** functionality for important AI insights

## ðŸ§  **AI Assistant Capabilities**

### **What the AI Knows About Each Patient:**

- âœ… Complete medical history and anamnesis
- âœ… All treatment sessions and progress notes
- âœ… Current diagnosis and treatment plans
- âœ… Pain levels and movement restrictions
- âœ… Previous AI conversations (conversation memory)
- âœ… Patient demographics and status

### **What You Can Ask:**

- **"Does Peter have any contraindications for [treatment]?"**
- **"What's Peter's treatment progress over the last month?"**
- **"Are there any red flags I should be aware of?"**
- **"What assessment techniques would work best for this patient?"**
- **"Has this patient shown improvement in [specific area]?"**

## ðŸ”§ **How to Use**

### **Method 1: From Patient Page (Recommended)**

1. **Go to any patient page**
2. **Click the "AI Assistant" button** (blue button with robot icon)
3. **Start chatting** with the patient-specific AI
4. **Ask clinical questions** about that specific patient

### **Method 2: General AI Chat (Still Available)**

- Go to **User Settings > AI Clinical Assistant** for general clinical questions
- Use patient-specific context by selecting patients from dropdown

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example Conversations**

### **Contraindications Check:**

```
You: "Does this patient have any contraindications for manual therapy?"
AI: "Based on Peter's history, yes - he has osteoporosis documented in his medical notes from [date], and his age (67) combined with recent fall history suggests caution with high-velocity manipulations. Consider gentle mobilization techniques instead."
```

### **Treatment Progress:**

```
You: "How has this patient's progress been?"
AI: "Peter's pain levels have decreased from 8/10 to 4/10 over the last 6 sessions. Movement restriction in shoulder flexion improved from 90Â° to 140Â°. However, his last session notes indicate increased stiffness after rest periods - consider adding home mobility exercises."
```

### **Clinical Insights:**

```
You: "Any patterns I should be aware of?"
AI: "I notice Peter's symptoms consistently worsen on Monday appointments, suggesting weekend activity aggravation. His pain levels correlate with weather changes mentioned in session notes. Consider discussing activity modification for weekends."
```
