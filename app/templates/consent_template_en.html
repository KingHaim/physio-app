<h3>INFORMED CONSENT</h3>
<h4>GENERAL PHYSIOTHERAPY</h4>
<p>
    This documentation has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the General Health Law 14/1986, of April 25, the Andalusian Health Law 2/1998, of June 15, and Law 41/2002, regulating the rights and obligations regarding information and clinical documentation, articles 8, 9, and 10.
</p>

<h4>GENERAL CONCEPT OF PHYSIOTHERAPY</h4>
<p>
    The main purpose of physiotherapy is to restore lost or deteriorated physical functions.
</p>
<p>
    It consists of treating the person, through evaluation, to prevent, correct, relieve, limit, or reduce physical disability, movement disorders, functionality, and posture, as well as treating pain resulting from these processes, whether acquired, congenital, and/or due to aging.
</p>
<p>
    Various agents and physical means are used, and depending on the agent employed, it is called:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Kinesiotherapy:</b> Set of therapeutic procedures aimed at treating pathologies through movement, whether passive, active, or communicated by some external means.</li>
        <li><b>Massage therapy:</b> Set of manipulations on a part of the body to mobilize tissues and provoke direct or reflex modifications resulting in therapeutic effects.</li>
        <li><b>Manual therapy:</b> Localization and treatment of musculoskeletal disorders using hands to unlock joints and muscle fixations, applying techniques and models for soft tissue therapy. Includes kinesiotherapy, massage therapy, and derivatives.</li>
        <li><b>Mechanotherapy:</b> Therapeutic use of mechanical devices to provoke and direct body movements regulated by strength, trajectory, and amplitude.</li>
        <li><b>Electrotherapy:</b> Treatment of certain pathologies using electricity or electromagnetic radiation applied to the body to improve tissue condition (trophic effect), relieve pain (analgesic effect), and aid motor recovery (excitomotor effect).</li>
        <li><b>Hydrotherapy:</b> Therapeutic use of water for its physical properties, mainly for its mechanical and thermal effects.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>RISKS</h4>
<p>
    The main risks in physiotherapy arise from incorrect indication and poor execution. Therefore, it is essential that a duly accredited physiotherapy professional carries it out.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, some consequences during treatment may include:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pain:</b> Muscle pain may be experienced, especially in the first sessions.</li>
        <li><b>Dizziness or vertigo:</b> Although relatively rare.</li>
        <li><b>Fracture/joint injury:</b> In some cases, deformities or pathologies such as osteoporosis may make the patient susceptible to injury. The physiotherapist will act with additional caution as needed.</li>
        <li><b>Galvanic accidents:</b> In electrotherapy, from mild skin irritation to electrical burns.</li>
        <li><b>High-frequency voltage arcs:</b> Caused by the application of internal or external metallic elements, producing pain, contracture, and burns (both external and internal).</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>GENERAL CONTRAINDICATIONS</h4>

    <b>Absolute:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Malignant tumors</li>

        <li>Decompensated chronic bronchitis</li>
        <li>Active thrombosis or hemorrhages</li>
        <li>Pacemakers and/or intracardiac devices (for electrotherapy)</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Relative:</b>

        <li>Sphincter incontinence (hydrotherapy)</li>
        <li>Skin diseases in case of sulfurous waters (hydrotherapy)</li>
        <li>Metallic implants such as endoprostheses, osteosynthesis (medium and high-frequency electrotherapy)</li>
        <li>Sensitivity alterations (electrotherapy, hydrotherapy)</li>
        <li>Abdominal and lumbar applications during menstruation (medium and high-frequency electrotherapy)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>TREATMENT RESULTS</h4>
<p>
    There are beneficial effects associated with these treatment methods, including pain reduction and muscle spasm relief, as well as improved function and joint mobility. However, healthcare is not an exact science, and there is no guarantee of a certain result from these methods.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the technique applied, your physiotherapist will indicate if you need to remove metallic objects or provide protective glasses.
</p>
<p>
    <b>You have the right to give consent for your treatment after receiving information, as well as to consent without receiving such information. In any case, you may withdraw your consent before the application of the technique or during its application.</b>
