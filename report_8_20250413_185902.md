# PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT PROGRESS REPORT

## 1. CLINICAL OVERVIEW
Patient presents with left clavicular fracture rehabilitation, with secondary focus on restoring left shoulder mobility (flexion, external rotation, internal rotation, abduction). Concurrent right knee cartilage involvement was noted but not the primary treatment focus. Treatment spanned 21 sessions over 2 months and 3 weeks, with notable fluctuations in pain levels (initial 1/10 increasing to 6/10 at final session).

## 2. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

### Initial Findings (Session 1):
- **ROM Deficits**:
  - Flexion: 75° AROM (achieved >90° PROM with resistance)
  - Extension: 25°
  - External Rotation: 15°
  - Internal Rotation: 35°
  - Abduction: 90°
- **Key Impairments**:
  - Significant external rotation limitation
  - Myofascial restrictions (pectoral major, trapezius, infrapsinatus)
  - Scapulohumeral rhythm dysfunction
- **Functional Limitations**:
  - Overhead movements restricted
  - Tennis-specific motions compromised

## 3. TREATMENT APPROACH

### Phase 1: Early Rehabilitation (Sessions 1-6)
- **Manual Therapy**:
  - Glenohumeral mobilizations (AP glides for external rotation)
  - PNF diagonals (Kabat patterns)
  - Trigger point release: pectoralis major, trapezius, infrapsinatus
- **Modalities**:
  - Therapeutic massage
  - TENS for pain management

### Phase 2: Progressive Loading (Sessions 7-15)
- **Mobility Focus**:
  - Progressive flexion gains (120°→155°)
  - External rotation targeting (27°→62°)
- **Strength Integration**:
  - Scapular stabilization exercises
  - Rotator cuff activation drills
- **Sport-Specific Prep**:
  - Tennis tolerance testing (Session 8: 3hrs play)

### Phase 3: Advanced Rehabilitation (Sessions 16-21)
- **Corticosteroid Intervention** (Session 18):
  - Post-injection exercise progression
- **Load Progression**:
  - Weighted exercises (2kg→3.5kg)
  - Push-up plus variations
- **Functional Training**:
  - 180°-90° circumduction with external rotation

## 4. PROGRESS EVALUATION

### ROM Improvements:
| Movement       | Initial | Final   | Gain  |
|----------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Flexion        | 75°     | 168°    | +93°  |
| External Rot   | 15°     | 75°     | +60°  |
| Abduction      | 90°     | Full    | N/A   |

### Pain Progression:
- Baseline: 1/10
- Mid-treatment: Fluctuated 1-5/10
- Current: 6/10 (noted with increased activity loading)

### Functional Gains:
- Achieved 3hr tennis play (Session 8)
- Independent HEP compliance with weighted exercises
- Full shoulder circumduction possible

## 5. CURRENT STATUS

### Positive Outcomes:
- Near-full flexion ROM (168°)
- Functional external rotation (75°)
- Independent exercise management

### Ongoing Concerns:
- Pain escalation with loading (6/10)
- Persistent trigger points (PVD, infrapsinatus)
- Strength deficits in rotator cuff

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS

### Treatment Continuation:
- 2x/week for 4 weeks focusing on:
  - Pain modulation strategies
  - Eccentric rotator cuff strengthening
  - Kinetic chain integration

### Home Program:
- **Phase 1** (Pain <4/10):
  - Isometric rotator cuff holds
  - Scapular clock exercises
- **Phase 2** (Pain <2/10):
  - Theraband ER/IR at 90° abduction
  - Plyometric chest passes

### Activity Modification:
- Temporary 20% reduction in tennis volume
- Ice application post-activity
- Nighttime positioning education

## 7. PROGNOSIS

### Expected Timeline:
- 6-8 weeks for pain normalization
- 3 months for full sport reintegration

### Influencing Factors:
- Positive: Excellent treatment adherence
- Negative: Recent pain escalation
- Neutral: Corticosteroid effects

### Long-Term Outlook:
Good for full functional recovery with continued strength progression. Annual shoulder screening recommended for maintenance.
